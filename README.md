YoutubeSearch (WIP)

## Introduction

Youtube Search is a plugin for the Fluent Search application, allowing for easy searching and downloading of the Youtube resources.

## Usage

The plugin currently exposes only one search tag. *Youtube* is the main entry point. After invoking the tag and your search term, results will start appearing as normal. Currently however, thumbnails are not displayed.

## Contributions

Please keep in mind that I am an inexperienced programmer and I wish to learn more from my projects. If you have any idea to make this code better, let me know or drop a pull request. EVery good word counts.
